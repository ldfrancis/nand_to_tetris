# nand_to_tetris [Course]
Designing a general purpose computer from the ground up. Based on the coursera course, [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome)

This repository contains the implementations for the concepts discussed in the course, consisting of a hardware (the HACK computer) and a software hierarchy that runs a tetris application. The hardware is developed in a hardware simulator. This project is divided into two parts, according to the course. The first part focuses on building the hardware while the second part focuses on the software. Inspired by the project's name, nand_to_tetris, the first part is named nand_to_hack and the second part, hack_to_tetris.
